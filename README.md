# Boltflow - introduction
#bolt

These documents describe my preferred way of working with Bolt, when it comes to the “dev ops” part of the process. So, the workflow of how to set up a Bolt instal in such a way that it’s pleasant to work with, easy to upgrade, and simple to deploy on a client’s server. 

Feel free to mix-and-match parts of this workflow to suit your own needs. You might prefer working in a different manner, or your environments are set up in a different manner.

Boltflow is divided into three parts:

* [Boltflow - Setting up a project](bear://x-callback-url/open-note?id=508138A5-A93D-45F3-9ED7-7318A0B6AF82-6993-00006C040BA349E5)
